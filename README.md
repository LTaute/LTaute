- 👋 Hi, I’m @LTaute (Luan Ivan Taute)
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software developer. Brand new to the industry. I just finished Html and CSS on FreeCodeCamp :D 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and loving the challenge. I will be working my way down the FreeCodeCamp course list!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Html and CSS Projects and soon Javascript projects as well.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me on email: taute.luan9@gmail.com
